# Basic usage: ./Mapping_miRNA_with_bowtie.py -r mature_miRNA_sequence.fa

# Dependency
1) python2.7 (with package: pandas)

# Note:
1) All 5 scripts must be in same directory!
   (scripts: Mapping_miRNA_with_bowtie.py, FastQcollapse.py, parse_bowtie_result.py, count_miRNA.py & extract_bowtie_unmapped_reads.py)
2) "mature_miRNA_sequence.fa" must be in DNA sequence!
   (if it's downloaded from miRBase, it is in RNA sequence)

# FINAL OUTPUT: 
1) Mapping_summary.txt	(format: "file_name" | "total_read" | "PM_read" | "PM%" | "1MM_read" | "1MM%" | "2MM_read" | "2MM%")
2) miRNA_count.txt	(format: "miR_name" | "pos:mut" | "read_count" | "total_miR_count (PM+1MM+2MM)")
+
3) bowtie_unmapped.fastq (optional, if option "-un" is used)
